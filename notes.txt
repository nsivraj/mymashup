// load a sequence of pages and make it so that each page
// loads completely before the subsequent page loads

1) DONE -- The mymashup.js file should only load the .js files to be used for executing the page sequence
2) There should be one kernel.js javascript that defines the URLHandler (GetURL) javascript object.
   The URLHandler javascript object must also support waiting a specified time duration before
   loading the next URL - this is useful for plugins like the PDF plugin that reports the page has
   already loaded but the actual content still has not loaded. There also needs to be a
   looping capability so that a given sequence of WebScreens and be looped over several times.
   There should also be a timing facility to cause the URLHandler object to wait until a particular
   time of day before it starts the WebScreen sequence.
3) Each other .js file defines a sequence of WebScreens and situational processing logic.
   These individual .js files MUST also contain their own startup methods that can be
   invoked via "repl.<methodName>()" with parameters being passed in if needed.
