1) Establish what the cannonical format will be for the stored data.
   This format will be all of the counselor data fields defined in
   the Double Knot data schema. This is the choice because that is
   the destination system for all of the data merges we are attempting
   to do in this effort. Still need to determine the order of the
   columns, this should follow closely the format established by
   Arturo Malpica, plus some extra columns to identify meta-data about
   the data being imported.

FortUtah-MCR-09032010-ListbyName.xlsx: This data is sorted by counselor
with a separate column for each merit badge the counselor is registered
for. There is also an additional "Troop Only" flag for each merit badge.

FortUtah-MCR-09032010-ListAll.txt:  This data is sorted by merit badge
with the counselors information showing up multiple times in the report.
The information for the counselor could be on either 2 or 3 lines.

record and it only lists one of the merit badges that the person might teach.
It has information about the position of the person and the sponsoring organization.

Master-MBC-FortUtahDistrict-Marzo142011.xlsx (or .csv): This report contains only
merit badge counselors and all of the merit badges that are listed in the national
system for them. It also has the Person ID column which should uniquely identify a
person. It's format is similar to but not exactly matching FortUtah-MCR-09032010-ListbyName.csv.

2) Write parsers and updaters to decide how to update the currently
   existing data stored in the canonical format using the exported files
   dumped out by the external systems. There will be one parser/updater
   per exported file from the external systems. If an external system
   provides more than one export file then there will be multiple
   parsers/updaters for that external system.
3) The rules in the parsers and updaters need to follow the boundary
   lines of National owning the person data and Double Knot owning
   the merit badge data.


Need to combine the National files together to get a wholistic view of the data from National.
Combine these files into a common file just to get a comprehensive view of leader data from National
and as a sanity check (the merit badge data in these National files is very old, don't use it, only
use the leader data, meaning only use names and address information for people but not merit badge
information):
** FortUtah-MCR-09032010-BSA.xlsx
** FortUtah-MCR-09032010-ListbyName.xlsx
** FortUtah-MCR-09032010-ListbyBadge.xlsx
** FortUtah-MCR-09032010-ListAll.txt

Also, need to merge the Double Knot exports into the national data but somehow only the merit badge data.
** DoubleknotExport.20101103.xls

Java code design
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Need to have a representation of a Counselor (with canonicalization rules for member variables) 
2) Need to have a representation of a Merit Badge (with canonicalization rules for name and number, maybe the merit badge is just
a comma separated list of numbers but you have to be able to go from name to number, this could be done by
using a static HashMap mapping of name to number, all of the data exports have the name of the merit badge and
not the number but the upload onto Double Knot takes a number or name and I would like to use the number
because it leaves less room for error during the upload) -- so for this we will have a MeritBadge java class
which has the code for canonicalizing the name and then mapping the name to the number, it will contain a
static HashMap that maps the canonicalized name to the number.
3) Need to parse the each file of data from National


Here is how you do a search and replace in "vi"
